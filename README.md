# Titanic Dataset Analysis

This project involves the analysis of the Titanic dataset to explore various aspects of the passenger data, such as survival rates by class and gender, and age distribution of survivors and non-survivors. The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) and the analysis is performed using Python with the help of libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.
## Introduction
